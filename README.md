# AI Thread Memory Enhancer

Time Travel for the Average AI Joe.

An AI Utility for fun.
Don't use my code to do bad sh*t.  
Oh the things we can all think of.
It's always the KISS principal, is it not?
<div style="border: 1px solid red; padding: 10px;">
NUMBER ONE THING HERE:
IF you are unable able to follow directions, give up now - because I'm doing this as a demo, okay?
</div>

What this does:
Extends an AI chat thread for greater customization in the event of a chat window closure/failure.
It simply saves your posts when your local memory is full.  
Why:
This leads to more customized/personalized/focused responses based on what you have already
fed the AI.

This utility requires you interact with the AI.  
<div style="border: 1px solid red; padding: 10px;">
NUMBER TWO THING HERE:
You better know how to train your dragon.  If it doesn't do what you say from the get, you got nothin.
</div>
You need to create a 'tag' for the AI responses that you would like to 'save'.
You need to modify this script for those tags, and it probably makes sense to tweak your time as well ;)

**System Build**

You need to use Chrome ATOTW  & download the correct driver. You need to be smart enough to do all these things.

Divers:
Chrome

Create a Project 
.
.
.
mkdir my_python_app
cd my_python_app
python3 -**m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
touch app.py  # On Windows: type nul > app.py
.
.
.
do all the things...
. 
.
.
pip install selenium...just use my file....

pip freeze > requirements.txt

chmod +x <your_app_name>.py



**Glossary (Because I make things up)**
-------------------------------------------------------------
ATOTW: At the time of this writing

MEM: How I tag my responses to be 'saved' (written to a local flat file) that I can then 'load' back into a new
into an AI thread manually to 'restore' beyond the base memory.

<> I put literals you need to replace in those tags because I like c++ books.

This is basically a summary of a chat thread's memory, ATOTW.
You can also do this:
""
can you dump thread memory please?
AI said:
I don't have the ability to directly display or dump the 
full memory of this thread. However, I can summarize what 
has been saved or clear the memory from this thread if 
you'd like.

Would you like me to clear this threadâ€™s memory or 
summarize what's stored?


You said:
summarize please
"

Back this up then reload - this should also work effectively.
This also implies the 'how' or 'when' processing of data and
how we would rev/throttle the systems.  There is a fine balance,
until there is not :)
